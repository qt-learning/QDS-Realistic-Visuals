# Realistic Visuals with Qt Design Studio

This is the repo for the Realistic Visuals with Qt Design Studio course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

- In this repo, you will find the examples of realistic visual techniques we are exploring in the course.
- Each branch represents a different stage of the learning process.
- If you get stuck or encounter issues, you can use these examples as references to get back up to speed and compare your progress.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with a branch for each stage of the learning process:

- The **main** branch contains an overview of all branches
- The **realistic-visuals** branch contains the project demonstrating HDR maps, reflection probes, and materials
- The **starting-ADAS** branch contains the basic ADAS interface from the Qt Design Studio View3D Basics course
- The **finished-ADAS** branch contains the complete, enhanced ADAS interface with realistic materials and lighting

To explore a specific stage, simply check out the corresponding branch.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Design Studio (version 4.6 or later) installed on your computer. You can download Qt Design Studio from the [Qt.io website](https://qt.io).

Once you have Qt Design Studio installed, head over to [Qt Academy](https://academy.qt.io) and follow along with the Realistic Visuals with Qt Design Studio course.

To work with a specific branch:
